Feature: Mindwm Lifecycle Management

  Background:
    Given an Ubuntu 24.04 system with 6 CPUs and 16 GB of RAM
    And the mindwm-gitops repository is cloned into the "~/mindwm-gitops" directory

  Scenario: Deploy Mindwm Cluster and Applications
    When God executes "make cluster"
    Then all nodes in Kubernetes are ready

    When God executes "make kcl_run"
    And God executes "make argocd"
    Then helm release "argocd" is deployed in "argocd" namespace

    When God executes "make argocd_app"
    Then the argocd "mindwm-gitops" application appears in "argocd" namespace

    When God executes "make argocd_app_sync_async"
    Then the argocd "mindwm-gitops" application is argocd namespace in a progressing status

    When God executes "make argocd_app_async_wait"
    Then all argocd applications are in a healthy state
      | ArgoCD Application name      |
      | cert-manager		     |
      | crossplane		     |
      | istio-base		     |
      | istio-ingressgateway	     |
      | istiod			     |
      | loki			     |
      | mindwm-gitops		     |
      | nats			     |
      | otel-collector		     |
      | promtail		     |
      | redpanda-operator	     |
      | tempo			     |
      | vm-aio			     |
      | redpanda-operator            |

    When God executes "make crossplane_rolebinding_workaround"
    Then the following roles should exist:
      | Role name                      |
      | crossplane-admin               |
    When God executes "make edit_hosts"
    Then file "/etc/hosts" contain "mindwm.local" regex

    When God executes "make forward_dns_cluster_local"
    Then domain name "<registry_domain>" should exist
    Examples:
    | registry_domain               |
    | zot-int.zot.svc.cluster.local |
