Feature: MindWM clipboard EDA test
  Background:
    Given A MindWM environment
    Then all nodes in Kubernetes are ready

  Scenario: Prepare environment for ping tests 
    When God creates a MindWM context with the name "<context>"
    Then the context should be ready and operable
    And the following knative services are in a ready state in the "context-<context>" namespace
      | Knative service name |
      | clipboard            |
    And statefulset "<context>-neo4j" in namespace "context-<context>" is in ready state

    When God creates a MindWM user resource with the name "<username>" and connects it to the context "<context>"
    Then the user resource should be ready and operable

    When God creates a MindWM host resource with the name "<host>" and connects it to the user "<username>"
    Then the host resource should be ready and operable
    And NatsJetStreamChannel "<host>-host-broker-kne-trigger" is ready in "user-<username>" namespace

    When God starts reading message from NATS topic ">"

    Examples:
     | context | username   | host      |
     | philadelphia   | flukeman   | the-host  | 

  Scenario: Send clipboard to knative ping service
    When God creates a new cloudevent 
      And sets cloudevent header "ce-subject" to "clipboard"
      And sets cloudevent header "ce-type" to "org.mindwm.v1.clipboard"
      And sets cloudevent header "ce-source" to "org.mindwm.<username>.<host>.clipboard"
      And sets cloudevent header "traceparent" to "<traceparent>"
      And sends cloudevent to knative service "clipboard" in "context-<context>" namespace

        "data": "clipboard primary data"
      } 
      """
      Then the response http code should be "200"

    Then the following deployments are in a ready state in the "context-<context>" namespace
      | Deployment name       |
      | clipboard-00001-deployment |

    Examples:
     | context | username   | host      | traceparent                                             |

  Scenario: Send ping directly to function <endpoint>

    # Then the trace with "<traceparent>" should appear in TraceQL

  Scenario: Send ping via nats
    When God creates a new cloudevent

  Scenario: Cleanup <username>@<host> in <context>
    When God deletes the MindWM host resource "<host>"
    Then the host "<host>" should be deleted

    When God deletes the MindWM user resource "<username>"

    When God deletes the MindWM context resource "<context>"
