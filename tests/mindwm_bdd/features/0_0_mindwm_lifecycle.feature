Feature: Mindwm Lifecycle Management

  Background:
    Given an Ubuntu 24.04 system with 6 CPUs and 16 GB of RAM
    And the mindwm-gitops repository is cloned into the "~/mindwm-gitops" directory

  Scenario: Deploy Mindwm Cluster and Applications
     When God executes "make cluster"
     Then all nodes in Kubernetes are ready

     When God executes "make argocd"
     Then helm release "argocd" is deployed in "argocd" namespace

     When God executes "make argocd_app"
     Then the argocd "mindwm-gitops" application appears in "argocd" namespace

    When God executes "make argocd_app_sync_async"
    Then the argocd "mindwm-gitops" application is argocd namespace in a progressing status 

    When God executes "make argocd_app_async_wait"
    Then all argocd applications are in a healthy state
      | ArgoCD Application name      |
      | cert-manager		     |
      | crossplane		     |
      | flux			     |
      | istio-base		     |
      | istio-ingressgateway	     |
      | istiod			     |
      | loki			     |
      | mindwm-gitops		     |
      | nats			     |
      | otel-collector		     |
      | promtail		     |
      | redpanda-operator	     |
      | tempo			     |
      | vm-aio			     |
      | redpanda-operator            |

   When God executes "make crossplane_rolebinding_workaround"
   Then the following roles should exist:
      | Role name                      |
#      | provider-kubernetes-admin      |
#     | provider-helm-admin            |
      | crossplane-admin               |
#      | jetstream-ch-dispatcher-admin  |
